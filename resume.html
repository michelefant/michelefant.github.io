			<p>I'm just a kid. I stay naive enough to keep positive.</p>
			<p>I’ve built my career in a variety of roles and industries where I was not just the art director but also creative strategist, and technology whiz. I’m not only used to wearing many hats, I sincerely enjoy it; I thrive in an environment where no two work days are exactly the same. I love being witty, subtle and different.</p>
